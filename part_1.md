Part 1: Visualization critique
------------------------------

##### Link to visualization: <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/27/upshot/make-your-own-mobility-animation.html?emc=edit_nn_20180328&nl=morning-briefing&nlid=6341375820180328&te=1>

The visualization that I chose to critique is in a New York Times online article that talks about a recent study done by Stanford, Harvard and the Census Bureau on income inequality and race in the United States. This research is part of The Equality of Opportunity Project and the data comes from 20 million children and their parents in the US. These children were followed into their late 30s with the intension of observing how their incomes as adults varied by race and gender.

The visualizations in the New York Times article are animated in order to illustrate the results from the study and are divided by gender, race and socioeconomic class. There are six graphics in the article and a seventh one were the reader can create his or her own mobility visualization by selecting from a array of variables and comparing different groups of the population. Since all the data come from the same source and the visualizations have little adjustments I will critique them generally and point out particular things about the seven graphs when I think it will be useful. My critique follows the framework established by Alberto Cairo in *The Truthful Art: Data, charts, and maps for Communication* about the five qualities of great visualizations. The five qualities are: truthfulness, functionality, esthetics, insightfulness and enlightening.

1.  **Is it truthful?** As mentioned above, Stanford and Harvard Universities and the Census Bureau execute The Equality of Opportunity Project. Academically speaking, both universities are highly recognized and the Census Bureau is a very well respected public institution. Additionally, the New York Times is well known to be a reliable news media. Together the four organizations are regarded highly and can be trusted as truthful sources. This research is extensive and meticulous and has been an ongoing for decades therefore, the publication of these results is extremely important for the project’s reputation. Given this, we know that the graphics are based on a thorough and honest research even though we cannot really tell by just looking at them without looking at the data or having more background information on the topic.

2.  **Is it functional?** These animated visualizations are extremely functional. As a reader you see the passing of time as the squares move from the left (the families socio-economic class when the individual was a child) into the right hand side (what socioeconomic class these individuals end up as adults). The flow of the squares from left to right straightforwardly depicts class mobility in the United States. For example, in the first graph, “Black and White Boys raised in wealthy families” one can immediately recognize that more white men (in green) become rich adults than black boys (in pink), and that black boys quickly fall into becoming poor, lower-middle or middle class adults. In comparison, when we see the fifth visualization, “Black and Hispanic children from all income groups, as measured by household income“ it is really easy to spot that Hispanics (green) are doing better than black (pink) Americans. The numbers and percentages on the right hand side of the visualization make it clear how the individuals are piling up for each class or gender. The numbers are more useful once the animation is completed in order to compare and contrast the numbers and percentages. One flaw that I see in these visualizations is that it takes more than a minute and a half from the start to the end of the animation. I feel that after looking at the second graph, and once you have familiarized with the graphics, you don’t want to wait that long for each of the following visualizations to animate.

3.  **Is it beautiful?** Yes. These visualizations are attractive, intriguing and aesthetically pleasing. The colors easily help us differentiate between the two comparison groups being made (either race or gender). I think that using more colors to differentiate between races and/or gender would have been helpful but I also understand that the researchers that did the visualizations probably didn’t want to associate one specific color with race or gender and therefore chose pink and green for all of the graphs. I think the animation of the graph is also beautiful because as mentioned already, the flow of the squares depict the actual mobility of individuals up and down the income ladder.

4.  **Is it insightful?** These visualizations are extremely insightful, as they clearly reveal the results of the study in a way that is easily understandable by the general public and more specifically whomever reads the New York Times. After looking cautiously at all the visualizations it is clear that white men earn more money than any other group (all other races and women). Each square in these visualizations represents a real person and if we follow its path, it reveals in an explicit way how individuals move from one class to another throughout their lives.

5.  **Is it enlightening?** The topic of income inequality is an extremely important one in order to identify what groups of people move up or down in socio-economic class. Tracking individuals throughout a long period of time from childhood into adulthood is extremely complicated and expensive and this study manages to do just this. It is probable that this topic is common knowledge; most people in the US probably realize that white men do better in life than any other race or gender. Furthermore, many academic theories behind this matter have been written over the years however, this research is empirical. From these six visualizations and being able to play around with the different variables to create our own, it is easy to understand that both gender and race play an important role in income inequality in the United States. It is also clear that white men are in an advantageous position. The visualizations are important tools to communicate the findings to a broader audience that would not otherwise read the full report.

In conclusion I would say that this is a very good visualization of income inequality in the United States.
